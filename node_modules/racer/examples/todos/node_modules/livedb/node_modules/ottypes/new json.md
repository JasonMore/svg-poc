# JSON6

Operations:

- **down:[k1, k2, â€¦]** - Descend into the current container at the current key, then skip by k1, then descend then skip by k2, etc.
- **up:N** - Go back up the stack toward the root by N levels.
- **skip:K** - Advance the position by K steps in the container element. If we're in a list, this increments the index by K (which must be a +ive number). If we're in an object, K is the new key, which must be alphabetically after the previous key.
